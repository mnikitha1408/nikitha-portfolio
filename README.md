# About me
Hi! I am Nikitha Mohan, a graduate student of Information Systems Management at Carnegie Mellon University.
I have a background in Computer Science and have always been amazed by how mere sequences of ones and zeroes are capable of simplifying life. I am particularly interested in teaching computers to understand and learn human language, and have been working towards it through academic courses, projects and internships. 
I have also really enjoyed learning about a wide range of subjects from Economics to Management Consulting, and cool technology like Blockchain.
Also, here are a few books I read during the summer - Simon Singh's The Codebook, Genghis Khan & the Making of the Modern World, The Nightingale.

## What I hope to learn
My ideal job would be to work as a Data Scientist/Strategy Consultant. 
I believe having good Data Visualization skills is important in this field and that I would greatly benefit from learning how to make better, more effective graphical use of data.
Data Visualization is central to a position where you are expected to help people without a lot of technical knowledge understand a highly technical project.
