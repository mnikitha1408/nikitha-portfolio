# What this portfolio is
This is my portfolio page for the Telling Stories with Data course at CMU (Fall, 2021). It is a documentation of my data viusalization journey over a period of 7 weeks. <br/><br/>The two 'Critique by Design' sections hold a behind-the-scenes narrative of the changes I made to existing charts to make them more effective.<br/><br/>
The other sections are dedicated to my final data story, Misinformation on Social Media, and how I approached it in iterations starting from gathering data to the final product.<br/><br/>
You can find my final data story here: [Misinformation on Social Media](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/misinformation-on-social-media/index.html)


# About me
Hi! I am Nikitha Mohan, a graduate student of Information Systems Management at Carnegie Mellon University.
I have a background in Computer Science and have always been amazed by how mere sequences of ones and zeroes are capable of changing the world. I am particularly interested in teaching computers to understand and learn human language, and have been working towards it through academic courses, projects and internships. 
<br/><br/>I have also really enjoyed learning about a wide range of subjects from Behavioural Economics to Management Consulting at CMU, and cool technology like Blockchain. <br/><br/>
Also, here are a few books I read recently - Simon Singh's The Codebook, Genghis Khan & the Making of the Modern World, The Nightingale and Walter Isaacson's Leonardo da Vinci.

## What I learnt from this course
How to make better, more effective data visualizations!<br/>
* I have learnt to critique visualizations (including my own) and that user research is very (very!) useful.<br/>
* As a Data Scientist (in the making), I hope to apply some of the skills I have picked up and utilize the resources/tools I have been exposed to.<br/>
* I have realised the importance of using data to tell stories that will have impact (especially to a non-technical audience).
