# About me
Hi! I am Nikitha Mohan, a graduate student of Information Systems Management at CMU. 
I have a background in Computer Science and picked up an interest in Natural Language Processing early on. 
Through academic courses, projects and internships, I have constantly been learning more about NLP as well as a wide range of subjects from Economics to Management Consulting, and cool technology like Blockchain.

## What I hope to learn
My ideal job would be to work as a Data Scientist/Strategy Consultant. 
I believe having good Data Visualization skills is important in this field and that I would greatly benefit from learning how to make better, more effective graphical use of data.
Data Visualization is central to a position where you are expected to help people without a lot of technical knowledge understand a highly technical project.
