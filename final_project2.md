# Why we need to talk about Misinformation on Social Media
[Back to Main](README.md/)

## What has changed from Part 1
The feedback I received from Part 1 told me that my scope was broad and that I needed to sharpen my message. I decided to scrape the idea of talking about what governments and Big Tech intervention could do to help and rather focus on what we, as individuals, can do to stop the spread of misinformation.

## Outline
1. Set the stage - Introduce my topic and provide definitions of social media and misinformation.
2. Establish the importance of the topic I have chosen. This will be done by showing the pervasiveness of social media. I want to get across the point that a LOT of people are on social media and that (mis)information really does have an impact.
3. Next, I want the audience to focus on one particular aspect of social media that enables misinformation to spread like wildfire - That a huge proportion of adults across the world rely on social media to get their news and to stay up-to-date on current events.
4. Then, I want to support my message with an incident that happened in South India which was fueled by misonformation,that led to the death of an innocent man.
5. After having established the seriousness and the potential harm that misinformation could lead to, I want to give the audience an actionable plan that they can follow to reduce the spread of misinformation and make better decisions when they go online.
