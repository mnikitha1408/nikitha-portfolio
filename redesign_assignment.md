# Critique by Design (Assignment 3 & 4)

## Step One: Find a data visualization

I came across a very interesting chart on Statista that was depicting restaurant performance in the United States over the last decade.
I was driven to investigating it because the chart took a **single** relatively straightforward measurement (not commenting on how it is measured) and complicated it. 
At first glance, I knew that it could be improved.
