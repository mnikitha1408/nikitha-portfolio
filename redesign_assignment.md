# Critique by Design (Assignment 3 & 4)

## Step One: Find a data visualization

I came across a very interesting chart on Statista that was depicting restaurant performance in the United States over the last decade.<br/>
I was driven to investigating it because the chart took a **single** relatively straightforward measurement (not commenting on how it is measured) and complicated it. <br/>
At first glance, I knew that it could be improved.<br/>
Here is the link to the chart,
https://www.statista.com/statistics/214747/us-restaurant-performance-index/

Here is a screenshot of it,

Some context that might be necessary,<br/>
The resuarant performance index measures the overall health of the US restaurant industry. The index is based on the results of a monthly survey that is composed of a variety of indicators including sales, traffic, labor and capital expenditures. A value above 100 signals a period of expansion while a value below 100 signals a period of contraction.


## Step Two: Critique
Using Stephen Few's DataVisualization Effectiveness Profile, I critiqued the chart on how informative and emotive it was. 
I first determined who I taught could be the potential audience and judged the chart's usefulness to them.
