# Critique by Design (Assignment 3 & 4)

## Step One: Find a data visualization

I came across a very interesting chart on Statista that was depicting restaurant performance in the United States over the last decade.<br/>
I was driven to investigating it because the chart took a **single** relatively straightforward measurement (not commenting on how it is measured) and complicated it. <br/>
At first glance, I knew that it could be improved.<br/>
Here is the link to the chart,
https://www.statista.com/statistics/214747/us-restaurant-performance-index/

Here is a screenshot of it,

Some context that might be necessary,<br/>
The restuarant performance index measures the overall health of the US restaurant industry. The index is based on the results of a monthly survey that is composed of a variety of indicators including sales, traffic, labor and capital expenditures. A value above 100 signals a period of expansion while a value below 100 signals a period of contraction.


## Step Two: Critique
Using Stephen Few's *Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile*, I critiqued the chart on how informative and emotive it was. 
Identified potential audience - Food critics, bloggers, city council members etc.
**Usefulness:** I rated it low here because I felt that the chart would not be very useful to the identified audience. The only data point shown is a very broad measure, the performance index. We do not have any data on the different components that make up the index itself (like demographics, sales, capital expenditure etc.). 
**Completeness:** It did not really contain all the information that was necessary to make it understandable. There was no context on what the restaurant performance index was and why the Y-axis started at 92.5
**Perceptability:** Although the chart did not make illogical comparisons, it is not easily perceptive. I had to spend time carefully going over the lines to understand that it was trying to show the difference through the years. Even the pop-up box (when scrolling over a data point) was not easy to understand.
**Truthfulness:** The chart does not misrepresent any data or make any comparisons that aren't correct.
**Intuitiveness:** I rated it very low on intuitiveness because I felt that the X-axis with the months was different. And the years were not arranged in any particular manner because it was showing the trend line and that made it more counterintuitive. 
**Aesthetics:** I rated it low on aesthetics because there are too many colours on the chart. The legend is not helpful at all. I mistook the incomplete data for 2021 as the data for 2013 because both of them were very similar shades of grey. 
**Engagement:** It was average on engagement because I felt like the audience would be compelled to try and make sense of the chart. 


### The Good Charts Method:
* At first glance: A lot of lines. Too many colours. One line that abruptly ends. 
* What worked: The font on the axes is pleasant. I like the grid lines (it is easy to associate with the Y-axis label values.)
* What didnâ€™t work: The title is too long. The years are not on the X-axis (it is not intuitive). Associating each colour to the corresponding year is very confusing. Comparing the differences between the years is difficult. The chart is too congested (too many lines). 
* What I would do differently: I would first provide some context about what the restaurant performance index is. I would shorten the title. I would also highlight 2015 and 2020 to show the stark difference between them.
