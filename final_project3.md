# Why we need to talk about Misinformation on Social Media
[Back to Main](README.md/)

## Changes from Part 2
I took into account the feedback from the wireframes, from the group discussion in class and the Part 2 assignment comments. 
The overall takeaway was that the impact of misinformation was not immediately clear and that the flow of the story could be improved.

### Data visualizations
1. The World Population and Social Media piechart - I changed the order of the data in the chart and the label for the population not on social media (I learnt from the user research that it was easy to misinterpret/)
2. I removed the line chart depicting the percentage of U.S Adults on social media. I do not understand why I decided to include it in the first place because I am not telling a story that is only about the United States.
3. Instead, I added a new line chart showing the growing number of social media users across the globe.
4. I retained the Social Media as a News Source chart although it was identified as confusing in Part 2 because I felt it did support my story and that it was providing information on different countries across the world and it was important to me to keep it global.
5. I also designed two infograms to support the takeaways from the 'Social Media as News Source' chart. I used them to reinforce that a majority of social media users rely on social media for their daily news.

### Structure, flow and design
* I restructed the draft of my story on Shorthand that I used as my storyboard in Part 2. 
* Retained the definitions of social media and misinformation because I wanted everyone to follow my story.
* Used a question-answer format to tell the story because it helped with the flow of the story.
* Began by talking about how almost everyone on the internet is on social media (I moved up the internet pie chart).
* Talked about how much of the global population is on social media to emphasize on the reach and impact social media could potentially have.
* I added the part about the increasing number of users because I wanted to show that social media is not going away and that it has been steadily increasing through the last decade.
* I made sure to draw attention to the percentage of social media users getting their news from these platforms because my user research told me it was not being communicated in my storyboard.
* I found a study that was conducted that measured the spread of misinfomration on Twitter and used it to support my story.
* Added details to my case study in India and made sure to provide context by talking about how important WhatsApp is in India so that the bar chart was clear and how it was relevant for me to talk about it here.
* In order to show that negative outcomes as a result of misinformation was not isolaed to India, I included three (of many) incidents that took place around the world. 
* I felt my call-to-action from Part 2 was pretty solid and went with it.

### Audience
I did not want to restrict my audience by awareness or age group. It is for everyone but could be especially useful to raise awareness in the pre-teen, teen and 40+ categories.
