# Let's do something about Misinformation on Social Media

[Back to Main](/README.md)

## Summary
Social media (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram etc.) is a powerful tool, and has more or less, changed the way we communicate. The number of users on these platforms have been steadily increasing through the years, and there are no rules that govern engagement. <br/>I want to talk about about an (unanticiapted?) side-effect that has serious and negative impacts on society outside of the virtual world. My aim is to create awareness, to encourage people to talk about Misinformation or Fake News on social media, and help them to make better decisions when they go online.
