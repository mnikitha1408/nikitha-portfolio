# Let's do something about Misinformation on Social Media

[Back to Main](/README.md)

## Summary
Social media (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram etc.) is a powerful tool, and has more or less, changed the way we communicate. The number of users on these platforms have been steadily increasing through the years, and there are no rules that govern engagement. <br/><br/>I want to talk about about an (unanticiapted?) side-effect that has serious and negative impacts on society outside of this virtual world. My aim is to create awareness, to encourage people to talk about **Misinformation & Fake News on social media**, and help them to make better decisions when they go online.

## Structure
I want to take the audience through a journey as follows,
* First, I want to establish the pervasiveness and strength of social media.
* Then, some information about how many people get their news from social media. 
* Walk the audience through some examples: Case studies - the 2016 US Elections & Covid vaccine.
* Conclusion - How can we combat misinformation? What is Big Tech doing about it? What can governments do?
